## Introduction
When we are unleashing our shoelaces, a problem might occur in our minds - Is there a general way to represent a complicated knot following a few basic steps?
With no doubt, this question has already been studied and well-resolved by some famous mathematicians. 
Carl Friedrich Gauss made foundational contirbutions to knot theory, including the introduction to the Gauss diagrams, which can encode the knots projections.
Then it's Alexandira who invented the Alexandira polynomials.
In 1990, Jones was awarded the Fields Prize for his contributions in the Johns's ploynomial, which solves the antithesis of the problem, namely giving a ploynomial which can judge if the two knots are different, but requires further exploration if the two knots' polynomials are the same.
## Jone's Polynomial
Jone's ploynomial can express a knot into a polynomial. 
The gist of his method is to erase the intersections of a knot.
