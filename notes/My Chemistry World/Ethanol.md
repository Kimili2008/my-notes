$$2C_{2}H_{5}OH+2Na=2C_{2}H_{5}ONa+H_{2}$$
Replacement reaction: The H atom is replaced with Na
Put ethanol and oxyen together and use the heated copper as catalyst. The product is ethanal
$$2C_{2}H_{5}OH+O_{2}=^{Cu \Delta}=2CH_{3}CHO+2H_{2}O$$
Note that ethanal ($CH_{3}CHO$) is a kind of colorless liquid with a strong smell under room temperature



$$6H^{+}+3C_{2}H_{5}OH+K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}=2Cr^{3+}+3CH_{3}COOH+4H_{2}O$$
This equation is used to test unconscious driving after drinking ethanol beverage.

Notes on how to calculate the oxidation state in compound
Take ethanol as an example:
formula: $CH_{3}CH_{2}OH$
The average of C is -2
The 1st C: C-H bond each minus 1, C is -3
The 2nd C: C-H bond each minus 1, the C-O bond adds 1. Hence, C is -1
Overall is -2
