Definition: Unsaturated cyclo conjugate structure which is hard to start an addition reaction and hard to start an electrophilic addition and redox.
Traits: These atoms are usally aromatic, but not all of them.
## Why are they stable?
For a benzene ring, the carbon atoms resonates now and then, making the double bonds moving from one atom to another. This lowers the energy. 
Also, the delocalized $\pi$ electrons in the p orbital forms a giant $\pi$ bond.
## How to find aromaricity?
Huckel's law (empirical fact)
if the numbers of electrons in the great $\pi$ bond $=4n+2$, aromatic
if $=4n$, anti-aromatic(the molecule becomes less stable)
else: non-aromatic

Experiment: send an increasing into-the-page magnetic field, if the molecule forms a current, then it has a giant $\pi$ bond.(lenz's law)
