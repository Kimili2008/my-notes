Definition:*The organic compound and its mirror image can't coincide each other.*
e.g. $CH_{4}$
## How to deduce a chiral molecule?
1. have a symcenter
2. have a symmetry plane
3. have a symmetry axis
if a molecule satifys none of them, then it's a chiral molecule.

Argument: All molecules containing a chiral carbon is also chiral. (wrong)
reason: A chiral structure's symmetry plane/center/axis is at the external. It would be possible if two chiral carbon atoms form a non-chiral structure.
