## Carbonhydrates (sugar)
$\text{ formula }C_{n}(H_{2}O)_{m}$

1. monosaccharide 单糖 （glucose, fructose)
2. disaccharide双糖 (sacharose, maltrose)
3. trisaccharide三糖 (starch, cellulose)
### glucose
葡萄糖
Has reducing ability, can react with Cu(OH)2 and produces Cu2O (brick-red)
A beautiful experiment:
When adding $AgNO_{3}$ to $NH_{4}^{+}$ solution, the unstable ppt. $AgOH$ quickly forms and disappears, which turns into $Ag_{2}O\text{ (brown) }$ and $H_{2}O$.
continue to add $NH_{4}^{+}\text{ solution }$ until there's no brown ppt., the $[Ag(NH_{3})_{2}]OH$ forms.

*Then, add glucose solution. The elemental Ag forms, showing that the glucose solution has reducing ability. *

$2AgOH=Ag_{2}O+H_{2}O$

### Sacharose maltrose
蔗糖和麦芽糖
$C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$
sacharose and maltrose are isomers.

Sacharose: has reducing ability
