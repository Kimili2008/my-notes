## Alkane
1. substitution
$CH_{4}+Cl_{2}=^{sunlight}=CH_{3}Cl+HCl$
$\text{ propagation1 }Cl.+CH_{4}=CH_{3}.+HCl$
$\text{ propagation2 }CH_{3}.+Cl_{2}=Cl.+CH_{3}Cl$
termination $Cl.+Cl.=Cl_{2}$
termination2 $CH_{3}.+Cl.=CH_{3}Cl$

The reaction continues until $CCl_{4}$forms.
烷烃的性质 Properties of Alkane
- C atom and h atom have similar electronegativites
- Alkane only contains C,H atoms
## Alkene

### Crude oil industry
major components:
mixture of various hydrocarbon with impurities
It releases lots of heat with burnt and it's safe to transport and maintain.
Products cover a wide range, including medicine, synthetic fiber, and synthetic rubber.

#### Fractional distillation
In a fractioning tower, the crude oil vapour passes through the tower. Its component gases passes through different trays that is sufficiently cool and condense to solid.
Note that the bottom of the tower has a high temperature so that gases with low boiling points doesn't condense at the bottom.

#### Thermal Cracking 
Using a higher temperature to make short alkanes into shorter alkanes.
$C_{16}H_{34}=^{\Delta^{catalyst}}=C_{8}H_{18}+C_{8}H_{16}$
$C_{4}H_{10}=^{high temperature}=C_{2}H_{6}+C_{2}H_{4}$


#### catalytic Cracking
Using a lower temperature and catalyst to cut long alkanes into short alkanes.

### Coal industry
Coal is a complex compound $C,H,O,N,S$
$C+H_{2}O=^{hightemp}=CO+H_{2}$
