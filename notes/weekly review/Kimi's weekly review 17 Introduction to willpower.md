This blogpost will be updated on a daily basis. In the digital era, willpower is becoming a severe problem due to many addicting apps and social media.
With no exception, I'm also struggling to overcome these issues, such as burning the night oil, forget important meetings. If you happen to come across this blog, then I recommend you to read 
[The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You ... - Kelly McGonigal, PhD - Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=4x1aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false)
This book gives you practical methodologies, along with real world examples, psychological control theories and detailed timeline based on the author's experience in Harvard. Undoubtly, you will benefit from this.

## Choosing different strategies
This book provides you with many tactics to overcome temptations. Remember to CHOOSE ONE AT A TIME. Don't rush or hurry. Willpower isn't something which can be established overnight.
In my first week (10/18–/25), I decided to utilize the "5-min breath control" tactic. This strategy forces you to meditate five minutes, which can be a good start to boost your brain power.
In my plan, each three sober hours means one five minute meditation.
