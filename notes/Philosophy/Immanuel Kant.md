Branch: Metaphysics
Approach: Transcendental Idealism

BEFORE: 
René Descartes publishes his *Meditations*, in which he doubts all knowledge except his own consciousness. (Rationalism)
David Hume publishes his *treatise of human nature*, which suggests limitations on how the human mind perceives reality. (Empiricalism)

AFTER:
In the 19th century, the *German idealist movement* is triggered by Kant (thing-in-itself and limitations of reason)
Inspired Edmund Husserl (phenomenology)

### the problem of science

Trigger: Kant wondered why natural science developed so much in recent decades compared to the relative stagnation before.

The answer given by Kant is 
1. Due to *John Locke, David Hume* (empirical), scientists have focused on observations more carefully. 
2. A new scientific method arose that made empirical observations valuable: Concepts like force can be perfectly described mathematically. It also tests its own conceptions of the world by asking specific questions about nature and observing the answers.  

### Intuitions and concepts
Our experiences of the world includes two main things: sensibility (empirical) and understanding  (the ability to use concepts). 

For Kant, a concept is an indirect acquaintance with things as examples of a type of thing, such as the concept of "book" in general. 

Two type of concepts:
Priori: space and time, substances, things etc.
Empirical: pen, computers, bottles.

So in this way, Kant's transcendental Idealism can be conceived as the combintaion for empiricalism and rationalism. 
`In fact, the history of philosophy is often divided by the era with Kant, and the era without Kant. `

### The limits of knowledge

A philosophical position that asserts that some state or activity of the mind is prior to and more fundamental than things we experience is called idealism. 
For Kant, that's "transcendental Idealism".

He thinks that `space, time, and certain concepts are features of the world we experience, not the real world as it is.`
Our senses are like operating system for a software, and the hardware is the real world. So we can't use the knowledge and pattern in the software to describe the hardware world.

What's why Kant thinks that some metaphysical questions are invalid. Like: Does god exist? Do souls exist? We are trying to explore the "things-in-themselves" world, and this world can't be known.

**Human reason is troubled by questions that it cannot dismiss, but also cannot answer.**
-Kant
