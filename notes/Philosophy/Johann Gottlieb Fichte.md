He claimed that: **哲学体系的选择并非基于纯粹的逻辑证明，而是一种根植于个体存在方式的“决断”**。这不仅是一个认识论问题，更是一个**生存论**问题。

He is often thought as the connection between Hegal and Kant.  (Use the Absolute I as the first principle.)



**Idealism:** The starting point is the **Absolute I** and its **original act**. Its core proposition is **"the I posits itself."** This means **freedom, self-consciousness, and spontaneous activity** are primary and unconditional.

**Dogmatism:** The starting point is the **thing-in-itself** or substance. Its core is that **being, the thing, necessity** are primary. Thought and consciousness are merely derivative attributes or epiphenomena of this substance.

These two starting points are completely opposite in their **categories** and **direction of explanation**: one proceeds from the **subject** to explain the **object**, while the other proceeds from the **object** to explain the **subject**. Consequently, they constitute two **incommensurable** worldviews.
