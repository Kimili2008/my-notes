These are all things which protects the circuit.
GFCI & RCD : Ground fault interrupter monitar and compares the current outputs and returns in a circuit, and breaks when there's a difference.

Circuit breakers: overloaded protections (The current in the main circuit increases when items are connected in series)
Fuses: short circuit protection
(protect the circuit from having a too large current to protect the appliances, for instance, when the positive anode and negative cathode connected to together, the current drastically increases and the fuses are melted, protecting the current.)
